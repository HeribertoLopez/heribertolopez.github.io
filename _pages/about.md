I am a recent graduate of the M.S. Statistics program at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. Prior to that, I obtained a B.A. in Economics from St. Olaf College. I am interested in Bayesian Statistics, specifically bayesian hierarchical modelling, causal inference and machine learning each with applications in public health, economics, and sports. 

I am currently on the job market, my resume is available [here](https://cryptpad.fr/file/#/2/file/8TO+zYLQmcK9HoFjTwbgw8gF/).
